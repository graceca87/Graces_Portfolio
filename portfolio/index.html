            <h1>Where did I come from?</h1>
                <p>
                I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I loved growing up there. There were tons of lakes and mountains and the ocean was only an hour's drive. I went to the University of New Hampshire where I studied Fine Arts and got my BFA with a focus in painting. After was full of wanderlust. That's when I hit the road for old Chicago, where my brother had been living.

          <div class="main-page-articles">
            <h1>How did I get here?</h1>
                <p>
                    After I moved to Chicago I worked in the service industry for a number of years as a server and then bartender. I kept painting and making art during this time. After a while I was no longer happy in the industry life. I started working on the CX team full time for an online artist centered ecommerce site. I also got married during that time (in June of 2021). After talking with a friend who is a developer I realized that what I want most is to be able to create things. I knew I needed to learn to code. That's when I started researching bootcamps and came across Coding Temple.

            <h1>More about me...</h1>
                <p>
                    I just turned 35 yesterday! (July 10th). I have two Boston Terriers whom I adore. I'm married to a union electrictian who loves metal and punk and is almost entirely covered head to toe in tattoes. I love messing around with indoor plants and have just started getting into gardening. I love treasure hunting at flea markets, estate sales, and thrift stores in my free time. I fall asleep every night to Forensic Files. I'm really excited to learn web development!
